# CriminalLaw

This is a tiny project for the learning of RNN tech.
I only use the text inside the criminal law to simply make a model that can keep generating characters behind the text you type at first.
If I have spare time in the future, I will make it a more concrete model that can stably generate some special texts.

(Now, its function is to remind myself that I have learned the surface of NLP, and I need to learn more lol)
